# Handwritten Number Predictor

### This project is an web application run locally that uses a model to classify handwritten numbers. The Convolutional Neural Network, created using Keras, was trained in on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. Users can provide an image of a handwritten number, and a prediction is made using the model. The frontend was made using HTML and CSS, and the backend was made using Python and the Flask package.

### The Python packages used in this project are as follows:

* Keras
* Numpy
* Flask

### The application can be run locally by pulling the contents of this repository, running the command "pip install -r requirements.txt", and running the main Python file App.py. Note: The Model Creation.ipynb file was used in the creation of the model, and is not necessary to run the code as is.
